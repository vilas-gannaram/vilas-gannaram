## Hi there 👋, I'm Vilas

I’m a self-taught Web Developer who works across the stack and enjoys building things that live on the web.

### 💻 What I do

- Work as a Web Developer at Aganitha Cognitive Solutions (Hyderabad, India)
- Build corporate websites, LLM-powered chat apps, and data-driven bioinformatics tools
- Work on projects where I handle both code and the small design details that bring it together.

### 🌱 My journey

- Bachelor's Degree in Arts (B.A), but found my passion in the web during college
- Started learning web development during the COVID lockdown — YouTube, Docs & tutorials were my go-to stop.
- Learned by building, breaking, debugging, and shipping small projects
- That curiosity turned into a career I love and continue to grow in every day

### 🗺️ Exploring Now

- Learning Go to build a stronger foundation in systems and backend.
- Digging into applied AI — LLMs and how they fit into real products.
- Tinkering with my Dell — wiped Windows and running Ubuntu single-boot
