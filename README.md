Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Vilas

Iâ€™m a self-taught Web Developer with 2.7+ years of IT experience working across the stack. I enjoy building at the intersection of development & design â€” where code meets creativity.

### ðŸ’» What I do

- Work as a Web Developer at Aganitha Cognitive Solutions (Hyderabad, India)
- Build corporate websites, LLM-powered chat apps, and data-driven bioinformatics tools
- Contribute to projects where I often play the role of a *de facto designer*

### ðŸŒ± My journey

- Background in Arts (B.A.), but found my passion in the web during college
- Started learning web development during the COVID lockdown â€” YouTube, docs & tutorials were my go-to stop.
- Learned by building, breaking, debugging, and shipping small projects
- That curiosity turned into a career I love and continue to grow in every day
